    <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
    <br>
    <p>In this section we give you a straightforward description on how to interact with this version of the game. For
        sure you must be anxious thinking "How do I win this thing?". Ok, let's go for it.</p>
    <h2>--- How the gamers are ranked ---</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>SCORE (+)</b> - More points, better rank.</li>
        <li><b>LIVES (+)</b> - More opportunity to play, better rank.</li>
        <li><b>SHOTS (-)</b> - Less shots, better rank. So, for two people with the same score, and the same amount of game
            lives, whoever shoots less scores better (frugality).</li>
        <li><b>NICKNAME</b> - Finally, if the destiny gives you a twin rank sibling, then your'e ranked in ascending
            order using the nickname. Please don't go crazy using a lot of @@@@ in front of your nickname, ok?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Every time that you restart the game, you reset your score. ;)
    </p>
    <h2>--- Register, login, and have fun ---</h2>
    <p>If this is your first time playing, then you will need to <b>REGISTER</b>, otherwise go straight to <b>LOGIN.</b></p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Define a good nickname</b>. This is the only info that will be shown for other players.</li>
        <li><b>Provide a VALID email.</b> Please be sure to have access to this email so you can receive the confirmation link. 
        <li><b>Define your password.</b> This is for fun, don't expend too much time thinking about passwords. We all hate passwords, but this is content to another chalk talk. Password needs to have 6 characters or more. We still don't have a "I forgot my password" function. So, take one simple and memorize it.
        <li><b>Provide your company's domain.</b> This is important because we would like to know which partners and customers were here.</li>
    </ul>

        After signing in, you will be taken to a state where the game will be waiting for a session to start. This task will keep running the test until a session is opened. If no session is available, you can opt to close this screen, and subsequent pop-up screens, to get to the welcome screen and play alone. When playing alone, your score is not recorded.

        When a session is available, you will be taken to this screen. Here you can choose to join the session, or play alone. 
        When you join the session, your score is resetted to zero and you will be competing again. If you decide to play alone, your score will not be considered.
